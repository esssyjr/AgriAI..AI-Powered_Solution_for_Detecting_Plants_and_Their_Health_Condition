# AgriAI: AI-Powered Solution for Detecting Plants and Their Health Condition

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered system designed to detect plants and classify their health status. The system leverages deep learning to provide accurate and efficient plant monitoring. The detection model, built using YOLOv8, identifies sesame plants in an image, while the classification model, based on a pre-trained MobileNet, determines whether a plant is healthy or diseased. The ultimate goal is to integrate this system into a drone for automated farm monitoring and crop health assessment.

## Features
- **Sesame Plant Detection:** Uses YOLOv8 to detect sesame plants in an image and draw bounding boxes.
- **Health Classification:** Employs a pre-trained MobileNet model to classify plants as either healthy or diseased.
- **Scalability:** The system is designed to be integrated into drones for automated surveillance and response.

## Dataset Link
   - **Detection Dataset:** I collected and annotated sesame plant images, available on Kaggle. ðŸ“‚ **[Detection (Sesame) Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ismailismailtijjani/keke-napep-tricycle-dataset)**  
- **Classification Dataset:** I used open sourced dataset. ðŸ“‚ **[Classification (Bean) Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/therealoise/bean-disease-dataset)**
