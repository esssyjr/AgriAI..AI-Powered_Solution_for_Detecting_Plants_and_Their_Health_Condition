# FCMB Agritech Hackathon: AI-Powered Bean Disease Classification and Plant Detection System

This project, developed for the **FCMB Agritech Hackathon**, leverages AI to help farmers and agricultural stakeholders monitor crop health and detect plant. The solution combines **plant detection** and **health condition** into a single, user-friendly interface. It allows users to either classify the health of bean plants (healthy vs. unhealthy) or detect plants with bounding boxes, providing an integrated approach to improving crop management and productivity.

## Project Overview

Efficient crop monitoring and disease detection are crucial for modern agritech solutions. In this project, we offer two AI-powered functionalities that can be used on farms or in agricultural research:

- **Health Condition:** Identifies whether a plant is healthy or affected by a disease. Early detection of diseases ensures that drone take action to prevent the spread, thereby increasing yield and crop quality.
- **Plant Detection:** Detects plants in an image and draws bounding boxes around them for easy visual identification. This feature is useful for monitoring plant growth or detecting specific crop types in the field.

## Key Features

1. **AI-based Bean Health Classification:**
   - Uses a pre-trained TensorFlow model to classify bean plants into two categories: "healthy" or "unhealthy."
   - Quick and reliable detection to aid farmers in identifying issues early.
  
2. **Plant Detection with YOLOv8:**
   - Detects plants in an image and draws **thick red bounding boxes** for better visibility.
   - Useful for monitoring crop presence, density, and potential growth issues.

3. **Model Selection via Web Interface:**
   - The user can select which model to use via a button on the web interface.
   - Switch between "Health Classification" and "Plant Detection" modes easily.

## Why This Solution Matters

The project aligns with the goals of the **FCMB Agritech Hackathon** by addressing critical agricultural challenges:

- **Timely disease detection**: Diseases in crops, can cause devastating losses. Early identification and treatment can save an entire harvest.
- **Plant identification**: Plant detection helps monitor crop development, ensuring optimal growth and efficient resource allocation.

By providing these functionalities, our solution empowers farmers with actionable insights, ultimately helping them maintain healthier crops, improve productivity, and reduce losses.
